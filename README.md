# Active Record!  Rejoice!

## Prompt:
For tonights homework we'll be revisiting the Cheesy SQL homework, but doing it with ActiveRecord!  This assignment has two parts:

## Part 1: ActiveRecord-fying SQL:

For this part you should edit this README.md. Take a look at each of the SQL commands and determine the ActiveRecord commands that should replace those SQL commands.  For each question replace the `#your active record solution` with the ActiveRecord command that does the same thing as the SQL command.

If you have any questions, or see anything you haven't seen yet, the [documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) for Rails is wonderful.

For all solutions, pretend that you have a model called `Cheese`.

#### Add these cheeses to your database:

- Roquefort, a yellow french cheese with a stink level of 5
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO cheeses (name, color, origin, stink_level) VALUES ('Roquefort', 'yellow', 'French', 5);
  ```

  ```ruby
 
  Cheese.new({ name: "Roquefort", color: "yellow", origin: "French", stink_level: 5})
  Cheese.create({ name: "Roquefort", color: "yellow", origin: "French", stink_level: 5})
  

  
  ```

- Charolais, a white french cheese with a stink level of 5
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO cheeses (name, color, origin, stink_level) VALUES ('Charolais', 'white', 'French', 5);
  ```

  ```ruby
  # your active record solution
  Cheese.create({ name: "Charolais", color: "white", origin: "French", stink_level: 5})

- Hooligan, a yellow American cheese with a stink level of 3
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO cheeses (name, color, origin, stink_level) VALUES ('Hooligan', 'yellow', 'American', 3);
  ```

  ```ruby
  # Cheeses.create({ name: "Hooligan", color: "yellow", origin: "American", stink_level: 3})

  ```
- Teleme, a white american cheese with a stink level of 2
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO cheeses (name, color, origin, stink_level) VALUES ('Teleme', 'white', 'American', 2);
  ```

  ```ruby
  # Cheeses.create({ name: "Teleme", color: "white", origin: "American", stink_level: 2})

  ```
- And then we inserted a few more cheeses, but I think you get the point.  Moving on!

#### Choosing Cheese


- Find all the cheeses
  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cheeses;
  ```

  ```ruby
  # cheeeses.all
  ```

- Find all the French cheeses
    
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM cheeses WHERE origin : 'French';
  ```

  ```ruby
  # cheeses.where({origin: "French"})
  ```
- Find all the English cheeses
    
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM cheeses WHERE origin : 'English';
  ```

  ```ruby
  # cheeses.where({origin: "English"}) 
  ```
- Find all cheeses with a stink level of 2
    
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM cheeses WHERE stink_level : 2;
  ```

  ```ruby
  # cheeses.where{(stink_level : 2)}
  ```
- Find all cheeses with a stink level of 10
    
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM cheeses WHERE stink_level : 10;
  ```

  ```ruby
  # cheeses.where{(stink_level : 10})
  ```
- Find all French cheeses with a stink level of 5
    
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM cheeses WHERE origin : 'French' AND stink_level : 5;
  ```

  ```ruby
  #  # cheeses.where({ origin : "Feench" AND stink_level : 5})
  ```
- Find all Irish cheeses with a stink level of 6
    
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM cheeses WHERE origin : 'Irish' AND stink_level : 6;
  ```

  ```ruby
   # cheeses.where({ origin : "Irish" AND stink_level : 6})
  ```
- Find all cheeses with a stink level of at least 4, but no greater than 8.
    
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM cheeses WHERE stink_level >= 4 OR stink_level <= 8;
  ```

  ```ruby
  # cheeses.where({ stink_level >= 4 OR stink_level <= 8})
  ```
- Find all American and English cheeses.
    
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM cheeses WHERE origin : 'American' OR origin : 'English';
  ```

  ```ruby
  # cheeses.where({ origin : "American" OR origin : "English"})
  ```
- Find all cheeses that are not from France.
    
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cheeses WHERE origin NOT IN ('French');
  ```

  ```ruby
  # cheeses.where.not ({ origin : French})
  ```


#### Restocking Cheese

The cheese game is changing constantly. Let's update our cheeses.

- Change the stink level of Roquefort to 3
    
  ```sql
  UPDATE cheeses SET stink_level = 3 WHERE name = 'Roquefort';
  ```

  ```ruby
  # Roquefort.update_attributes!({stink_level: 3})
  ```
- Change the color of Teleme to "mauve"
    
  ```sql
  UPDATE cheeses SET color = 'mauve' WHERE name = 'Teleme';
  ```

  ```ruby
  # your active record solution
  ```
- Delete the Hooligan cheese
    
  ```sql
  DELETE from cheeses WHERE name = 'Hooligan';
  ```

  ```ruby
  # Cheese.where({name: "Hooligan"}).destroy
  ```
- Change the stink level of Stichelton to be 7
    
  ```sql
  UPDATE cheeses SET stink_level = 7 WHERE name = 'Stichelton';
  ```

  ```ruby
  #   Cheese.where({name: Stichelton}).update_attribute({stink_level: 7})

  ```
- Add the cheese "Monterey Jack", an American cheese with a stink level of 0
    
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO cheeses (name, color, origin, stink_level) VALUES ('Monterey Jack', 'white', 'American', 0);
  ```

  ```ruby
  # your active record solution
  ```
- Delete Durrus
    
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM cheeses WHERE name = 'Durrus';
  ```

  ```ruby
  # Cheese.where({name: "Durrus"}).destroy
  ```

## Part 2: Review Today's Lesson:
Review the `README.md` file from today's lesson [here](https://github.com/WDI-HoneyBadger/w10d03-intro-to-rails) then answer the following questions:

- In express we built our routes inside of our controller, where do you put routes in a rails app?
  ```
  # app

  ```
  # singular
  ```
- What kind of files belong in the `assets` directory?
  ```
  # images 
  ```
- What does the command `rails db:drop` do?
  ```
  # will drop/delete the data 
  ```
- What does the command `rails c` do?
  ```
  # It will open rails console 
  ```
- What is an ORM?  What does it stand for?
  ```
  # object relational mapping
   It allows us to communicate with database using ruby
  ```
